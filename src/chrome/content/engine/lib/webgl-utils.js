 * will attempt to present an approriate message to the user.

 *       gl = WebGLUtils.setupWebGL(canvas);
 *
 * For animated WebGL apps use of setTimeout or setInterval are
 * discouraged. It is recommended you structure your rendering

 *

 * This will call your rendering function up to the refresh rate
 * of your display but will stop rendering if your app is not
 * visible.
